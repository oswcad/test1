### Combinational Boolean logic design

This app generates:
- A truth table of up to 4 inputs and 2 outputs
- Boolean equations in Sum-of-Products of *minterms* for each output
- Karnaugh maps showing groups of minterms to minimize each output
- Boolean equations in Sum-of-Products for the mimimized outputs
- Basic AND, OR, NOT gate circuit diagrams for each minimized output
- Basic SystemVerilog code that implements the truth table

Inputs: Write up to 4 input labels separated by commas
Outputs: Write up to 2 inputs labels separated by commas

- Select Minterms
- Toggle "Don't care" button and select don't care terms if neded 

Submit: Press to build the table
Reset: Start all over 

Tabs: One for each of Table, Karnaugh Maps, Circuits and Code in SystemVerilog
